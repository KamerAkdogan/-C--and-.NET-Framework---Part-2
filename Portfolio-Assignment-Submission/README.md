Polymorphism Assignment

This project demonstrates polymorphism by using an IQuittable interface and an Employee class. An Employee object is referenced as an IQuittable type, and the Quit() method is executed to illustrate polymorphic behavior.

Operators Assignment

This project focuses on operator overloading in C#. The Employee class overloads the == and != operators to compare employees by their ID. The Equals() and GetHashCode() methods are also overridden to ensure accurate comparison behavior.
